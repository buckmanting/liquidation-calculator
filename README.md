# Liquidation Calculator

## What is this?
Works out how much the employees of some people could be owed. Really not useful to anyone, but a select few.

## Get it going
Just the standard `npm i` to install dependencies.

Then to run `npm start`, or to start with a file watch `npm run start:local`.

Easy 👍
